    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <section>
        <p>In 2007 myself, with a group of former Leicester Panther players and their partners, organised a charity game between the Leicester Panthers "Old Boys" and the Loughborough University Aces.
            This turned out to be one of the biggest British American Football games in over 10 years, with nearly 10,000 fans attending the "Matt Hampson Bowl" 0'14 at the Leicester Tigers Stadium.
            The event raised over £40,000 for the Matt Hampson Trust and from this game, the idea of Football America UK was born and our business commenced.
